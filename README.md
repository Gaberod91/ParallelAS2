For my solution for problem #1, I utilized ExecutorService to with a fixed thread pool size and implemented runnable so that instances can be executed by threads. I slept the threads to ensure that guests randomly entered the maze, and once a guest entered, the maze was locked. Once a guest has left the maze, the maze is then unlocked for another guest to enter.
For my solution for problem #2, option 2 would seem the best. Option 1 isn't optimal because it would lead to congestion at the door with no guarantee of being able to see the vase. A benefit could be that guests have the complete freedom to check the door whenever they want regardless of its status. Option 3 could lead to potentially very long queue, with guests being able to see the vase multiple times, it could lead to guests monopolizing the room. A benefit could be that the line would be organized and eliminate the need to check room availability. The best option, option 2, is the superior choice because guests can simply check the sign and move on, freeing up congestion and optimizing guests ability to view the vase and not monopolize the line.
